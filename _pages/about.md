Welcome! I'm a PhD student and aspiring remote sensing scientist at the [Center for Systems Integration & Sustainability](https://www.canr.msu.edu/csis/) at Michigan State University interested in using satellite data to measure changes in environmental systems. 
  
Currently, I study the interconnected effects of natural disasters across the globe using the [metacoupling framework](https://www.canr.msu.edu/telecoupling/metacoupling/#:~:text=The%20telecoupling%20framework%20allows%20researchers%20to%20build%20models,fisheries%20management%2C%20biodiversity%20conservation%2C%20land%20use%20and%20more.). 

My Academic History
======
I earned my B.S. in Geology and B.A. in Environmental Studies from Kent State University. While there, I started my research career studying the geochemistry of streams impacted by acid-mine drainage, then moved up in resolution to focusing on portions of Lake Erie impacted by Harmful Algal Blooms.   
After graduation, I became a member of the [Assal Biogeography & Landscape Dynamics Lab](https://assallab.org/) and learned more about spatial data analysis at the landscape scale. 

Finally, I joined MSU to focus on the connections *between* landscapes and how we can study some of the indirect drivers of change.
